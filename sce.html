      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p>
        My SCE is a utility app for SoCal Edison. It is mainly used for managing SCE accounts, reporting and checking
        power outages,
        and finding information about SCE services and programs. My SCE is a fairly simple and straightforward app, and
        therefore usable
        by almost everyone. However, it has a very poorly designed user interface, which looks almost identical to SoCal
        Edison’s website.</p>
      <br>

      <br>
      <h1>Outcome</h1>
      <p>
        In order to address the problem, we redesigned My SCE as a whole, and <em>focused on its relationship with SCE's
          website</em>.

          It appeared that the development team used the same code base without considering

      <h1>Competitive Analysis</h1>
      <div class='quote width70'>
        <p>
          <em>If you want to get a lay of the land before you dive in, and the best way to do that is by looking around
            and seeing who else is in the space with you.</em>
          <br>---- Professor Bietz
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2>Comparing and Contrasting Market Offerings</h2>
      <p>
        We examined four competitors - <em>DWP Rates, SDG&E, SoCalGas, Cox Connect</em>. The main service My SCE and other
        offerings provide is a way for its customers to be able to pay their utility bills through mobile devices and
        find information about what services are provided by their utility company.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        A common set of functionality between the different electric utility apps includes:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Viewing / Paying bills<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. An outage map listing where planned and unplanned outages are
        taking place<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Reporting outages<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. A cCost calculator that adds up energy costs from appliance use or
        overall energy use<br>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>My SCE provides all the information and features that you could find on their main website, while other apps
        provide a more simplistic interface, which
        provides a smaller set of information. The downside to this approach is that the interface mostly copies the
        website’s layout, so looking through the information on the mobile app is cumbersome. </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Since energy companies service a specific coverage area, the user base for each app corresponds to homeowners
        and businesses found in those areas. Southern California Edison, whose app is the main interface we explored,
        services electricity to much of Southern California. Other electricity utilities operate in locations where SCE
        is not operating. Each utility company has a monopoly over their own area. <br><br>This
        means that
        even direct competitors don’t overlap in customers. That being said, the Southern
        California Gas Company (SoCalGas), a gas utility company, offers its services to the same households and
        businesses as SCE.
      </p><br>
      <p>Strengthening its mobile platform is a way for SCE to make itself stand out from the others,
        while providing modern solutions for its customers to manage their utility expenses.</p>

      <img class="comparsion" src="Images/sce/SCEcomparison.png" alt="old version of SCE" width="550">
      <h1>User Research</h1>

      <h2>Study Objectives</h2>
      <p>Considering the user base of SCE and its app, we want to feature understand the relationship between the mobile
        app and uitlity services. Thus, we list out the following study Objectives.
       
      </p>
      <p>1. How do mobile apps support a certain lifestyle?</p>
      <p>2. Are there different expectations for what a mobile app should do versus what a website should do?
        (features/characteristics people would like the app to prossess)</p>
      <p>3. What role does technology play in bill paying and solving utility-related problems?</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Research Method</h2>
      <p>To better understand our target user group, we use <em>semi-structured interviews</em> and a <em>survey</em> as
        our methods
        to acquire the data that we need. As a result, We have <em>10</em> interviewers and <em>42</em> survey
        participants.
        <p>We asked questions relating to demographics, mobile app use, and bill payment strategies. The interview
          subjects are selected from our friends who pay their own utility bills. Since one of our target population
          groups is college students whose age in range of 18 to 22, our focus
          would be on finding how they pay their bills as well as hearing their complaints on current payment method and
          other problems that bothered them while using services.</p>

        <p>Reaching out to our other target population, older homeowners, was more difficult to do.
          Some of our members were able to rely on family members to participate in our interviews, but for the surveys
          we didn’t have a
          convenient communication channel to get as many participants as we would have hoped.
        </p>
        <br>
        <div class="ideate">
          <h2>Ideate<p>After conducting interviews, I transcribed the interviews and created the Affinity Diagram that
              contains
              all
              the pain points,
              desires, and their past experiences of using utility apps.</p>
            <p>This helped us to organize our thoughts and notes, also gave me the initial idea of redesign.</p>

        </div>

        <br>
        <div class="population">
          <h2>Target Population</h2>
          <p>
            Our main target populations are <em>college students</em> that rent an apartment or a room and <em>working
              homeowners</em>.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>College Students</h3>

          <p> For many college students, they are new to living on their own. The lack of experience in living on their
            own means an unfamiliarity with paying bills.</p>
          <h4>Their concerns...</h4>
          <br>
          <div class="concerns">
            <p>I want an easier way to pay bills, like Apple Pay</p>
            <p>Wish I can deal all utility-related problems in one place</p>
            <p>I would like to have an app that notifies my bills, usage, etc.</p>
            <p>I would like an easier way to contact SCE to deal with outage</p>
          </div>

          <h3>Homeowners</h3>
          <p>
            Homeowners generally in a higher economic class compared to renters or even younger homeowners. Concerning
            older homeowner, some of the assumptions that we made when we first selected them as our target
            population turned out to be incorrect.
            <p>We assumed that they would be less tech knowledgeable, which would affect their preferences in paying
              their electric bill. This wasn’t the case,
              as our interviewees and survey respondents stated that they were comfortable in using the web or mobile
              apps in their daily lives. </p>
            <p> Their preference towards the website in particular was
              based on <em>how conveniently using the interface</em> fit in with their lifestyle rather being unable to
              use the
              mobile platform.</p>

          </p>
          <h4>Their concerns...</h4>
          <br>
          <div class="concerns">
            <p>Be able to qucikly access the bills and statement</p>
            <p>If I could manage Auto Pay on phone that would be nice</p>
            <p>Have online chat feature so I do not have to call them</p>
            <p>Push me notifications when the bill is ready</p>
          </div>

        </div>

        <div class='finding'>
          <h2>Findings</h2>
          <p>According to our research on direct and indirect competitors, we have a thorough understanding of what My
            SCE as an utility company’s app should focus on.
          </p>
          <p>We did find out that some of our users are not comfortable with a subscription payment, and they
            inevitably, at least sometimes, missed the payment due, which can lead to overdue penalization fee or even
            utility shut downs.
            In this circumstance, having a <em>reminder feature</em> is preferable for those people who always forget to
            pay bill on time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another interesting finding is that, in <em>younger male demographic group</em>, interviewees and survey
            takers would like to have the option to use modern online payment methods rather than credit cards.
            They have listed Venmo, Apple Pay for preferred payment methods.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, A common quality that both of our target populations wanted to see was an interface that was
            both <em>easy and convenient to use. </em></p>
          <p><em>Students</em> wanted to see a well-designed mobile app so that they could pay bills or deal
            with emergencies since they’re always moving from one place to the next and won’t always have access to a
            computer. <br>
            <em>Older participants</em> favored the use of a website precisely
            because it fit in with how much time they spent at work or at home.
          </p>

    <article class="usability margin20">
      <h1>Usability Issues</h1>
      <h2>Methods</h2>
      <p>We conducted usability tests and Cognitive Walkthrough to acquire the information that we need.
      </p>
      <h3>Usability Tests</h3>
      <p>For the usability tests, the participants were given five tasks to complete in My SCE application. The
        participants of the usability tests were friends / classmates who had the time to assist us in our user
        research.
        Each usability test took about 20 minutes, accounting for both the usability test and the follow-up questions
        and discussion.
        <p> Participants were asked to complete the following tasks while thinking aloud:</p>
        <p>1. Pay electric bill for this month</p>
        <p>2. Find customer service information</p>
        <p>3. Check power outage in a certain area (via zip code)</p>
        <p>4. Change first name</p>
        <p>5. Report power outage for home or business</p>
      </p>
      <h3>Cognitive Walkthrough</h3>
      <p>The cognitive walkthrough involved every member of the redesign team, each member an expert user of the app,
        and sought to uncover usability issues in the UI. For the cognitive walkthrough, the redesign team analyzed
        three key tasks to identify potential usability issues:</p>
      <p>1. Change user’s first name</p>
      <p>2. View payment history for the month of February 2018</p>
      <p>3. Use search function to find bill statement</p>

      <br>
      <div class="usability-finding">
        <h2>Findings</h2>
        <h3>Signifier and affordance mismatch</h3>

        <p>In one of the tasks in the usability test, participants are asked to change the displayed name of the
          electricity account. Through this task, we find some problems with the signifier for the account management
          feature.</p>
        <p><em>The correct signifier for Account Management is bound to the wrong affordance</em>
          (Account Services button), and the wrong/unclear signifier (Identity button) is bound to the
          correct affordance. </p>
        <br>
        <h3>False signifier</h3>

        <p> When users try to view the history of statements, the text “View Bill” is underlined and colored in green,
          which makes it look like
          clickable.
          As we expect some kind of statement document to pop up, <em>nothing happens when the fake hyperlink is
            clicked</em>.
          It’s misleading, and violates
          usability principles.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Fails to provide easy reversal of actions</h3>

        <p>
          Some of the pages are <em>failed to provide a way to reverse actions</em>. </p>
        <p>For example, When filing outage report, users are presented with a 5-step process with no back/previous
          button. If a user
          made a mistake in a previous step, the only way to fix it is to click on ‘cancel’ and start over.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Bad interface layout </h3>

        <p>
          <em>The mobile application has the identical interface as the website</em>. This causes many basic functions,
          such as
          zooming and going back, fail to work on the app at all. In addition to that, some redundant designs results in
          difficult to
          access the basic features, and greatly
          reduce the user experience as well.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Some interface components do not appear properly</h3>

        <p>
          This problem worsens users’ overall user experience with the app. There are
          several places where the <em>inconsistency appears</em>.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Results do not meet the expectation</h3>

        <p>
          When users
          have trouble finding a feature or doesn’t feel like navigating through the menu,
          <em>the search bar would be a very useful tool in finding the desired page within the app</em>.</p>
        <p>
          The reality of the current
          search functionality, however, was far from that. When we typed in the keywords
          of a feature we wanted to use, <em>the app simply came up with a
            internet-browser-like page with the results from a web search</em> using the keywords
          we supplied.

      <h1>Redesign</h1>
      <h2>Early Phase</h2>
      <h3>Design Focus</h3>
      <p>
        Some key points about our new design:<Br>
        1. User interface should be simple and straightforward<br>
        2. Highlight the core features by using the Gestalt laws and size, as well as the
        visual hierarchy<br>
        3. Complied with design specifications, but not with heavy graphic design<br>
        4. Design should be smooth and not overwhelm<br>

      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Sketches</h3>
      <p>
        With the design goal in mind, we each sketched some redesign ideas. Then, we got together and presented our
        solutions and voted for the
        one we want for the app.
      </p>
      <p>Here are some of our initial sketches:</p>




      <div class="swiper mySwiper sketch">
        <div class="swiper-wrapper">
          <div class="swiper-slide">
            <img src="Images/sce/sketch1.png" alt="sketch1">
          </div>
          <div class="swiper-slide">
            <img src="Images/sce/sketch2.png" alt="sketch2">
          </div>
          <div class="swiper-slide">
            <img src="Images/sce/sketch3.png" alt="sketch3">
          </div>
          <div class="swiper-slide">
            <img src="Images/sce/sketch4.png" alt="sketch4">
          </div>
          <div class="swiper-slide">
            <img src="Images/sce/sketch5.png" alt="sketch5">
          </div>

        </div>
        <div class="swiper-button-next"></div>
        <div class="swiper-button-prev"></div>
        <div class="swiper-pagination"></div>
      </div>




      <h2>Agreeing to the Best Solution</h2>
      <p>There were contentions about if we should use Nick's interaction idea (Shown as Sketch#1) or other traditional
        design. </p>
      <p>
        As the figure shows above, the home page of the app has the main funcitons of the app placed vertically at the
        center of the screen. When user
        click one of the buttons, "Pay" for example, it would zoomin and shows the billing page. If the button is at
        left of the page, user slides left to
        go back; if at right side, then slide right.
      </p>
      <p>It is a very interesting way of interaction. Nevertheless, we decided to use the traditional interaction
        considering the characteristics and
        target audience of the app. Not everyone is tech-savvy, a new interaction design might increase learing curve
        greatly which was not what we want
        for an utility app.
      </p>
    </div>



    <div class="finaldesign padding20">
      <h2>High-Fidelity Prototypes</h2>
      <h3>Design Concept</h3>
      <p>
        For the final design, I organized the redundant funcitons by redesigning the menu bar and puting common features
        (e.g. Outage, Usage) into a individual section.
      </p>
      <p>
        I took black out of the color schemes. <br>
        The combination of black and white usually gives people the feeling of insecure. As an electricity company, we
        do not want this happens. Hence, we widely used
        yellow and dark green because they are mtch with the characteristics of an electricity app. <br>
        Yellow represents vigor and vitality; dark green represents green energy. I deem that the color selection would
        make the whole app calm and safe yet incandescent.

        In addition, I reworked "My Home" section at Discover page. Each section of this page could also be a great
        place to promote advertisements.

              <br>
              <p>
                1. The overall design of the app is not modern and user friendly. So we chose to redesign
                the whole app from the beginning in order to have a consistent UI design. <br>
                <p>2. The simplicity and planarization were important for an mobile App in 2019.
                  Nevertheless, after we delved into the color schemes more, the intention of the color became more and
                  more clear for us.
                  So in the login page, we decided to add more bright yellow and made the App looks more friendly. </p>

            <h4>Problems
              <p>
                1. The main colors of the login interface are black and yellow. This becomes a problem that usually the
                combination of
                these two colors represents warning and caution. <br>
                <p>
                  2. The interface design violates the design guideline of Apple iOS.
                </p>
                <p>
                  3. A false signifier (“remember me” option) - remember username only. Users have to input the password
                  again.
                </p>
                <p>
                  4. Login page is not the default page of the app when users open the app.

              <br>
              <p>
                1. From interviews and user surveys, most users were concerned with being able to access key features
                easily and quickly.
                By having content that isn’t relevant to their interests, users will be less likely to use the app.
                <br>
                <p>2. Redesigned nav bar helps users identify the current page. In addition, we observed that if users
                  tried to scroll past alert popups, they would end up skipping past some buttons or signifiers of the
                  interface.
                  Redesigning how alerts are handled would stop users from ignoring important interface components.</p>

              <p>
                1. Old design’s homepage didn’t properly present the main features of the app. When first entering the
                app, the home screen uses most of its space for an image and a link that redirects you away from the
                app. <br>
                <p>
                  2. Alerts pop up when loading up most pages in the old app, including the home page.

                1. Viewing utility bills and making a payment were the top two selected choices of why our survey takers

            <h4>Problems
              <p>
                1. TThe original ‘My bill’ page can be accessed through a multi-step path: home-> my account-> billing &
                payments. Viewing my bill is one of the most significant features of the sce mobile app, and this path
                is not very obvious and too tedious. <br>
                <p>
                  2. The UI of the old page doesn’t do a very good job at visualizing information regarding users’
                  current bill: the wording of the due date is very tedious, making it hard to read for users; the
                  difference between pay now and view bill isn’t obvious at first glance.

              <p>
                1. From analysis of the user survey, majority of users would like customer support to be present in the
                app. Thus, we think it’s important to make customer support easily discoverable.
                <br>
                <p>2. During the usability test, we found that most of our participants got confused over redundant
                  features, such as “My Home”. They were misguided by the name of these features (false signifier), and
                  therefore deviated from their original path. </p>

            <h4>Problems
              <p>
                1. The path to find customer service information is unnecessarily complicated. Users need to perform an
                extra step (clicking on “Contact Us”) to acquire customer service information when they are already on
                the customer support page.
                <br>
                <p>
                  2. Many features in the original app are redundant and unnecessary. Yet, their names are misleading.
                  For example, the “My Home” feature, as shown in the third figure, displays nothing but advertisements
                  for SoCal Edison’s programs.

                1. In our usability test findings, a lot of users cannot find Outage Center as a first time user. The

                1. The original report outage page has an out-moded layout. It excessively uses inanimate colors and

                <p>

                finding the “Identity” page, which was hidden in the top right menu.

    <h1>Reflection</h1>
    <p>
      This was my first project to apply the UX design process and methods. Although it was only 10 weeks, this 
      project helped me to learn independently and build my first design (all the mockups were created via Adobe Photoshop); 
      it also spiked my interest in UX design. 
      During these 10 weeks working with one another, there were many ups and downs, but we learned how to efficiently express our critical opinions,
      also the ability to handle disagreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot forget the help from Professor Bitez and TA Hillary who gave us feedback, and guided us all the way. It was more than a project, it was a great experience that I will be cherished.
