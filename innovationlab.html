            <p>
                A website specifically for home infusion therapy treatment with both patients AND pharmacists in mind.
                Features like tutorial-viewing, pharmacist contacts, and daily reminders are meant to ease the confusing
                process of home infusion for patients, while the companion site for pharmacists will be used to track
                and update patient treatment.

            <h2>What is Infusion Therapy?</h2>
            <p>
                Infusion therapy treats infections through <em>self administered medication injections</em>. These
                require patients to use tools such as a syringe, pump, and picc line which is a long, thin, soft tube
                that is inserted into a vein.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Infusion therapy is usually done at home and patients are <em>expected to use these tools they likely
                    have never used before</em>. Anyone of any age can receive infusion therapy, but 60 year or older
                patients are the most common.
            </p>

        <h2>What is the problem with home infusions?</h2>
        <p>
            For the most part, it’s the ‘home’ aspect. The purpose of these infusions is to have patients
            self-administer once discharged
            from the hospital; however, <em>not all patients are medically trained to do the infusions. </em>

        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, <em>instructions</em>, which can come from a variety of sources like outdated prints or verbal
            notes from nurses and pharmacists themselves, <em>are conflicting and inconsistent. </em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometimes patients have to be readmitted to the hospital because they don’t know how to properly do the
            infusions.
        </p>
        <p>The following are some example of printed infusion instructions:</p>

            <h1>Research</h1>
            <h2>My team and I performed interviews with pharmacists and patients</h2>
            <p>In order to better understand the needs of both patients and pharmacists, with the help of our sponsors,
                we had the chance to interview five pharmacists and five patients.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Patients</h3>
            <p>
                For patients, there are a lot of obstacles need to overcome. For example:<br>
                1. When the medication was coming<br>
                2. Who was bringing the medication<br>
                3. When were they starting the procedure<br>
                4. Whether they'd have a nurse to help<br>
                5. "Once the medication leaves office, they do not care; they just provide medication and leave the
                situation as is."
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Interviewees mentioned that it was frustrating and overwhelming to get a bag full of things that you
                have never seen before.
                There are <em>NO resources</em> to know whether what you were doing was correct because the
                <em>instructions are
                    usually not detailed/comprehensive enough</em> - lacking details like how fast to give the
                medication, the correct preparation with
                medication before you even inject it (e.g. break it and put it in the back and shake it before putting
                it into the saline solution, drip it for a
                certain amount of time), etc.<br>
                Moreover, sometimes there were <em>conflicting instructions between what they were given vs. told</em>.
                Our interviewees mentioned that at the hospital, the infusions were
                every 10 hours but after the patient been discharged to home, it changed to every 12 hours without
                telling a reason.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Although home infusion can be wearisome, patients usually prefer to stay home. However, when the
                patients leave the hospital, it is hard to
                get in touch again. Sometimes, the package even does not include contacts or pharmacy
                information.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h3>Pharmacists</h3>
            <p>
                We had learned a lot from pharmacists, especially the information regarding HIPPA; for example,
                they need patients to sign the consent form before texting.
                Some of the regulations even affected our software design decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
                According to pharmacists, <em>most people do not know about home infusions until they are actually
                    prescribed</em>, so it may not be that common in the first place. Home infusions are usually the
                last thing that they resort to when infections are that bad.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                One of the pharmacists we interviewed mentioned that she worked with the technician team so that each team
                has a designated pharmacist and technician to work with specific patients.
                Although they teach patients how to do it and there are some introduction printouts of infusion therapy on their
                website, learning how to infuse the medications on their own is still quite tricky.

    <div class="margin20 paddingtop5 paddingb5">
        <h1>User Requirements</h1>
        <p>
            After we finished the interviews, I learned that it is easy to make assumptions about what users want,
            rather than what
            they really need. We further transcribed the interviews to make sure the requirements cover up their pain
            points and desires.

        <p>
            I enjoyed working with my team, sponsors, and instructors for the past six months. I am indebted that I had
            this opportunity to reach out and work with professionals in the industry.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through this project, the biggest takeaway is that the business goal is equally important as the design
            goal. We, as a designer, want to create a beautiful and elegant product. However, we need to also keep in
            mind that our design must deliver to the end-users.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Many thanks to my teammates, sponsors, and instructors for guiding us throughout the process; also my
            friends who taught me the basic knowledge of backend programming. Although the pandemic caused this project
            to be extra challenging, and we did not have a chance to meet in person, I still appreciate all the bits of
            help and memories from everyone.
