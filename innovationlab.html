            <p>
                A website specifically for home infusion therapy treatment with both patients AND pharmacists in mind.
                Features like tutorial-viewing, pharmacist contacts, and daily reminders are meant to ease the confusing
                process of home infusion for patients, while the companion site for pharmacists will be used to track
                and update patient treatment.

            <h2>What is Infusion Therapy?</h2>
            <p>
                Infusion therapy treats infections through <em>self administered medication injections</em>. These
                require patients to use tools such as a syringe, pump, and picc line which is a long, thin, soft tube
                that is inserted into a vein.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Infusion therapy is usually done at home and patients are <em>expected to use these tools they likely
                    have never used before</em>. Anyone of any age can receive infusion therapy, but 60 year or older
                patients are the most common.
            </p>

        <h2>What is the problem with home infusions?</h2>
        <p>
            For the most part, it’s the ‘home’ aspect. The purpose of these infusions is to have patients
            self-administer once discharged
            from the hospital; however, <em>not all patients are medically trained to do the infusions. </em>

        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, <em>instructions</em>, which can come from a variety of sources like outdated prints or verbal
            notes from nurses and pharmacists themselves, <em>are conflicting and inconsistent. </em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometimes patients have to be readmitted to the hospital because they don’t know how to properly do the
            infusions.
        </p>
        <p>The following are some example of printed infusion instructions:</p>

            <h2>HIDI is a web app that allows patients to check their treatment tutorials, contact pharmacists, schedule
                and
                reminders for infusion treatments. Pharmacists also can keep track of patients and their infusion
                treatments.

            <h1>Research</h1>
            <h2>My team and I performed interviews with pharmacists and patients</h2>
            <p>In order to better understand the needs from both patients and pharmacists, by the helping from our sponsors,
                we had chance to interview five pharmacists and five patients.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Patients</h3>
            <p>
                For patients, there are a lot of obstacles need to overcome. For example:<br>
                1. When the medication was coming<br>
                2. Who was bringing the medication<br>
                3. When were they starting the procedure<br>
                4. Whether they'd have a nurse to help<br>  
                5. "Once the medication leaves office, they do not care; they just provide medication and leave the situation as is."
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Interviewees mentioned that it was frustrating and overwhelming to get a bag full of things that you have never seen before. 
                In addition, there are <em>NO resources</em> to know whether what you were doing was correct because the <em>instructions are 
                usually not detailed/comprehensive enough</em> - lacking details like how fast to give the medication, the correct preparation with 
                medication before you even inject it (e.g. break it and put it in the back and shake it before putting it into the saline solution, drip it for a 
                certain amount of time), etc.<br>
                Moreover, sometimes there were <em>conflicting instructions between what they were given vs. told</em>. Our interviewees mentions that at the hospital, the infusions were 
                every 10 hours but after the patient been discharged to home, it changed to every 12 hours without telling the reason.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Although, home infusion can be wearisome but patients usually prefer to stay at home. However, when the patients leave the hospital, it is hard to 
                get in touch with them again. Sometimes, the package even does not include contacts or pharmacy information.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h3>Pharmacists</h3>
            <p>
                We had learned a lot from pharmacists, especially those information in regarding to HIPPA; for example, they need patients to sign the consent form before they can text. 
                Some of the regulations even affected our software design decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
                According to pharmacists, <em>most people do not know about home infusions until they are actually prescribed</em>, so it may not be that common in the first place. Home infusions are usually the last thing that they resort to when infections are that bad. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                One of the pharmacist we interviewed mentioned that she worked with technician team, so that each team has a designated pharmacist and technician to work with certain patients. 
                Although they teach patients how to do it and there are introduction to infusion therapy on their website, but learning the process of how to infuse the medications on their own is still difficult.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="margin20 paddingtop5 paddingb5">
        <h1>User Requirements</h1>
        <p>
            After we finished the interviews, I learned that it is easy to make assumptions about what users want, rather than what
            they really need. We further transcribed the interviews to make sure the requirements cover up their pain points and desires. 
        </p>
        <h2>Patient</h2>
        <p>
            1. Digitizing existing documentation of post-care instructional infusion papers<br>
            2. Alarm functionality for patients who wish to be notified about medication times<br>
            3. Helpful resources to assist patients such as direct connection sources to the pharmacy providing medication<br>
            4. Post-care patients should be able to easily access their patient-specific instructions through the web platform
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Medical Professionals</h2>
        <p>
            1. Ability to edit, update or make notes on the instructions<br>
            2. Ability to edit, update on the alarms
